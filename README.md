# RentMyCar Application

Welcome to the RentMyCar application, a sustainable car-sharing platform built with Kotlin and Ktor. This README will guide you through the steps required to install and run this application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **JDK 11 or higher**: Make sure you have the appropriate Java Development Kit installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- **Gradle**: The build tool used for this project. You can download it from [here](https://gradle.org/install/).
- **PostgreSQL**: The database system used by this application.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install PostgreSQL

To install PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

- Visit the PostgreSQL [download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- Select your operating system and follow the installation instructions.
- After installation, ensure that PostgreSQL is running and you have access to the `psql` command-line tool.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JopBogers2/proftaak_1_fsa.git
cd proftaak_1_fsa
```

### 3. Configure the Application

The application requires configuration for database connections and other environment-specific settings:

- Copy the example configuration file to create your actual configuration file:

  ```bash
  cp src/main/resources/application.example.conf src/main/resources/application.conf
  ```

- Open `src/main/resources/application.conf` and fill in the correct data, such as your PostgreSQL database credentials and any other necessary configurations.

### 4. Build the Application

Use Gradle to build the project:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### 5. Run the Application

Once the application is built, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

The application should now be running, and you can access it at `http://localhost:8080` or the configured host and port specified in your `application.conf` file.

### 6. Running Tests

To run all tests, use the following Gradle command:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

This will execute all the unit and integration tests to ensure that everything is working correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or running the application, consider the following:

- **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and that the credentials in `application.conf` are correct.
- **Dependencies**: If you encounter missing dependencies, try running `./gradlew clean build` to refresh your Gradle cache.
